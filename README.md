<h1>Level-1-Rocket</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration of Rocket Launch](https://youtube.com/shorts/gnUIQKrEAl4)

<h2>Description</h2>
This rocket was used for my Level 1 Certification with Tripoli Rocketry Association, Inc.. In the video, its apogee was roughly 1500 feet. Also, the rocket was about 5'7" tall. It was successful on its first launch.

<h2>Motor Used</h2>

- <b>H219T-14A Blue Thunder / 38mm x 155mm</b> 

<h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>

- <b>The only big challenge in this project was finding a way to get the motor to fit inside the rocket. My rocket had a 54mm wide barrel in the aft end to fit the motor in, but the motor I used was only 38mm wide. I needed something that could fit with the motor inside the aft end barrel, so it would not fall out. With the help of one of my Argo Armada teammates, we created a motor adapter that would friction-fit itself with the motor (shown in the photo below). I then scewed a hole with a hook attachment on it and then drilled the screw down so that the hook attachment would keep the adapter in place. It ended up working perfectly.  </b>
